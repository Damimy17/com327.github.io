<header><h2>Problem:</h2>

    You are working on a Python script that processes user input and calculates the total price of items purchased. However, the script is returning a wrong total price â€” the calculation seems to be missing some items.
    

<h2>Procedure:</h2>
    <p>1. Review the Python script to understand how the total price is calculated.</p>
    <p>2. Check the input data to ensure all items are being processed correctly.</p>
    <p>3. Debug the script to identify and fix the issue with the total price calculation.</p>
    <p>4. Test the script with different input scenarios to verify that the total price is calculated accurately.</p>
    <p>5. Document the changes made to the script and provide a summary of the debugging process.</p>
    <h2>Expected Output:</h2>
    <p>After debugging the script, the total price calculation should be corrected, and the script should return the accurate total price of items purchased.</p>
    <h2>Additional Information:</h2>
    <p>The Python script uses a list of items and their corresponding prices to calculate the total price. The script should iterate through the list of items, calculate the total price based on the quantity of each item purchased, and return the final total price.</p>
    <h2>Resources:</h2>
    <p>Python script for calculating total price of items purchased</p>
    <p>Sample input data for testing the script</p>
    <p>Debugging tools and techniques for identifying and fixing issues in Python scripts</p>
    <p>Documentation guidelines for recording changes and debugging process</p>
    <p>Testing scenarios to verify the accuracy of the total price calculation</p>
    <p>Summary template for documenting the debugging process and outcomes</p>
    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>After following the debugging procedure and making necessary changes to the Python script, the total price calculation issue should be resolved, and the script should return the correct total price of items purchased.</p>
    <h2>Recommendations:</h2>
    <p>Ensure thorough testing of the script with different input scenarios to validate the accuracy of the total price calculation.</p>
    <p>Document the debugging process, changes made, and testing outcomes for future reference and troubleshooting.</p>
    <p>Consider implementing error handling and validation checks to prevent similar issues in the future.</p>
    <p>Seek feedback from peers or mentors to review the debugging process and provide additional insights or recommendations.</p>
